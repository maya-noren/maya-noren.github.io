    <h2>Gelatinous Zooplankton & the Biological Pump</h2>
    <p class="post-date">March 20, 2025</p>

    <h2 class="post-subheader">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        As atmospheric carbon dioxide continues to rise, the ocean plays a crucial role 
        in regulating and mitigating carbon levels. Carbon sequestration is the process 
        by which carbon sinks to the deep ocean floor and is then stored on “time scales 
        that are significant for ecological and climate processes,” (Archibald et al., 2019). 
        Current research documents multiple carbon flows that transport it downwards. As 
        Archibald et al. and Baker et al. note, there are two primary pathways for carbon 
        export; passive transportation though particulate sinking and active transport through 
        diel vertical migration (DVM). DVM is where deep sea residing zooplankton and micronekton 
        travel to the surface at night in order to maximise feeding opportunities whilst minimizing 
        predation risk (Cook et al., 2023). Archibald et al. specifically focuses on the importance 
        of DVM in the global carbon network, yet notes that the role of DVM remains largely 
        unquantified. Archibald et al.’s paper “Modeling the impact of zooplankton diel vertical 
        migration on the carbon export flux of the biological pump” attempts to quantify DVM though 
        a simplified model of the carbon flow, leading to statistical evidence that largely agrees 
        with existing research. Also recognizing the role of DVM in the global carbon network, Baker 
        et al. focus on the potentially overlooked mesopelagic-migrant pump as a component of the 
        larger biological pump. The mesopelagic, or twilight, zone (200-1000 m) is where zooplankton 
        such as giant larvaceans and jellyfish thrive; these gelatinous zooplankton participate in 
        DVM, where their carcasses and other carbon-storing organic matter actively travel into the 
        deep - a process also referred to as the mesopelagic-migrant pump (Baker et al., 2025; 
        Jaspers et al., 2023; Sweetman & Chapman, 2015). Tracking the contributions of different 
        carbon pathways through the water column is vital in understanding the overall oceanic ecosystem, 
        biological pump, and climate change. Despite this, there remains gaps in research - due to 
        the difficulties in obtaining direct measurements in the mesopelagic zone and volatility of 
        gelatinous zooplankton - therefore continuing to create various models to predict the carbon 
        flows is vital in furthering comprehension of integrated oceanic mechanisms. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        According to the current academic consensus, DVM’s function in the biological pump remains 
        underestimated, despite the necessity it plays in carbon cycling. The biological pump is directly 
        related to climate change, as the carbon transported below the pycnocline through the sinking of 
        phytoplankton, marine snow, fecal material, carcasses, and active migrations of zooplankton and 
        mesopelagic fish is sequestered for centuries (Baker et al., 2025; Jaspers et al., 2023). According 
        to Jaspers et al. in “Gelatinous larvacean zooplankton can enhance trophic transfer and carbon 
        sequestration,” and similarly echoed by Cook et al., without the storage of carbon in the deep, 
        atmospheric CO2 would be twice as high; it is necessary to develop our understanding and quantify 
        the biological pump in relation to the future climate. In order to create a comprehensive model of 
        the biological pump, diel vertical migration cannot be overlooked - 10-30% of total particulate flux 
        and up to 50% of metabolic carbon produced in the mesopelagic zone is transported via DVM (Archibald 
        et al., 2019). There exists a myriad of zooplankton and micronekton communities in multiple oceanic 
        zones that interact with the biological pump though DVM, making it a tricky process to parameterize 
        (Archibald et al., 2019; Cook et al., 2023). In an attempt to bypass such difficulties, Archibald et 
        al. simplify the model by “assuming general principles and parameters for the pelagic ecosystem that 
        were applied globally, [which] allowed us to work around the problem of incomplete knowledge concerning 
        regional differences in the plankton community.” Archibald et al.’s findings line up with current 
        statistics accounting for DVM, agreeing that 13% to 58% of passive sinking flux is mediated by migrating 
        zooplankton and as much as 50% of dissolved inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic is produced by migrating 
        zooplankton. It is appropriate to mention that the majority of particulate organic carbon is recycled in 
        the twilight zone (70-85%; Jaspers et al., 2023). By and large, contemporary research documenting the 
        biological pump overlooks the magnitude of diel vertical migration by zooplankton (primarily in the 
        mesopelagic zone), despite the significant component it makes up. Articles such as “Carbon budgets of 
        Scotia Sea mesopelagic zooplankton and micronekton communities during austral spring” and “Modeling the 
        impact of zooplankton diel vertical migration on the carbon export flux of the biological pump” represent 
        the first step to filling this gap and including DVM in larger-scale water column models, correspondingly 
        coming to the same conclusion that quantifies DVM in the global carbon network. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Before moving further with case examples of gelatinous zooplankton contributing to the biological pump, 
        it is pertinent to address the specific challenges of measuring and modeling carbon export from the 
        twilight zone. Generally, it is rare for DVM-mediated carbon fluxes to be quantified by numerical models, 
        largely simplifying the biological pump (Archibald et al., 2019; Baker et al., 2025). First off, as 
        Archibald et al. mention, global studies of the biological pump are expensive and logistically challenging. 
        Though this poses some restriction on data collection, the primary challenge arises from sampling methodology 
        (Baker et al., 2025; Cook et al., 2023; Jaspers et al., 2023). Cook et al. contend that direct measurements 
        from the mesopelagic remain limited since “it is difficult to collect animals for incubation measurements 
        without damaging them, and it is also hard to replicate the changing temperature and pressure conditions 
        experienced in situ during migration.” Additionally, particular species may be neglected in samples; 
        micronekton and fish engage in daytime active net avoidance, while gelatinous organisms are underrepresented 
        in echograms, complicating migration depth measurements (Baker et al., 2025; Cook et al., 2023). Thereby, 
        taxon-specific DVM behavior and environmental conditions present difficulties in collecting samples. Now, 
        due to such constraints, there is a lack of empirical observations in the Southern Ocean (where a lot of 
        the world’s dissolved inorganic carbon is stored), representing a notable knowledge gap in quantification 
        of downward carbon export (Baker et al., 2025). In contrast, Jaspers et al. suggest that missing carbon 
        pathways constitute a more important knowledge gap, as current estimated particle export from the epipelagic, 
        or sunlight, zone (0-200 m) is only 30-50% of that needed to sustain midwater animals. What both papers agree 
        upon, however, is that without this data - whether it be critical carbon pathways or broader empirical evidence 
        - models of DVM, and, in turn, the biological pump, and, will be incomplete.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Articles taking a less experiment-based approach (so unlike Archbald et al. and Baker et al.’s studies) 
        provide results analogous to a species of interest. First, we must narrow the scope of focus, as the 
        biological carbon pump can be broken down into passive and active transport processes, known as particle 
        injection pumps (Baker et al., 2025). The particle injection pump specifically facilitating DVM is known 
        as the mesopelagic-migrant pump (MMP), where micronekton and mesozooplankton actively move carbon from 
        the epipelagic zone to mesopelagic zone, meaning they feed at the sea surface - absorbing atmospheric 
        carbon - and release it in the mesopelagic zone. MMP accounts for 1.5% to 89% of downward carbon export 
        relative to the magnitude of the biological pump (Baker et al., 2025). This figure matches the results 
        of Archibald et al., as it represents a range for overall DVM transportation. Baker et al. explain that 
        in the MMP, carbon is released in four ways: excretion (dissolved organic carbon, or DOC), respiration 
        (dissolved inorganic carbon, or DIC), fecal pellets (particulate organic matter, or POC), and carcasses 
        (POC). These pathways are “created” by diverse zooplankton, including copepods, pelagic tunicates 
        (larvaceans, salps, pyrosomes), and jellyfish (Archibald et al., 2019; Baker et al., 2025). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In particular, gelatinous zooplankton can be defined as “pelagic and [sharing] the characteristics of 
        a soft, translucent body texture,” (Jaspers et al., 2023). Jaspers et al. in their article “Gelatinous 
        larvacean zooplankton can enhance trophic transfer and carbon sequestration” identify larvaceans as an 
        underrepresented yet highly abundant species of gelatinous zooplankton, while Sweetman & Chapman in “First 
        assessment of flux rates of jellyfish carcasses (jelly-falls) to the benthos reveals the importance of 
        gelatinous material for biological C-cycling in jellyfish-dominated ecosystems” track “jelly-falls” of 
        deep-sea mesopelagic medusa jellyfish, Periphylla periphylla. These two papers illustrate distinct (and 
        underrepresented) aspects of the variety of identified zooplankton while relating them both to similar 
        DVM functions. This is reflective of a broader pattern of current research glossing over the notable 
        contributions of gelatinous zooplankton to the biological pump and instead focusing on copepods or 
        mesopelagic fish.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As previously  mentioned, one such species is larvaceans: translucent, free-swimming, pelagic tunicates, 
        with giant larvaceans (Bathochordaeus spp.) being up to 40 mm long and found in the mesopelagic zone. As 
        one of the most abundant and ubiquitous gelatinous zooplankton, Larvaceans make up 7.1% of all zooplankton 
        worldwide. Their abundance in addition to high production levels mean that they contribute substantially to 
        trophic transfer and carbon sequestration. Larvaceans produce delicate houses, composed of cellulose and 
        mucopolysaccharides, that often end up destroyed during sampling. However, these houses, up to seven times 
        longer than the animal trunk, represent almost 15% of the body carbon of the animal. Moreover, multiple 
        houses are produced per day, corresponding to an expenditure of 75-220% of a single larvacean’s biomass 
        per day. Larvacean houses constitute a considerable amount of carbon for downward export as marine snow 
        (houses, phytoplankton aggregates, and fecal pellets impacted by physical and biological processes). When 
        marine snow passes below 200 m, it is highly likely to be sequestered. In the mesopelagic, giant larvaceans 
        accelerate carbon flux even more by clearing substantial water volumes (thus concentrating carbon) and 
        repackaging marine snow into larger, quickly-sinking particles (forming houses up to 2 m in diameter) 
        (Jaspers et al., 2023). This description of larvaceans is in alignment with general principles of 
        mesozooplankton facilitating carbon export, yet juxtaposes Baker et al.’s focus on copepods as a primary 
        contributor to MMP. Jaspers et al. propose that larvaceans, overlooked due to sampling difficulty, could 
        potentially be the key to filling gaps in current models of carbon flux. 
    </p>

        Similarly underrepresented in samples and potentially critical to MMP, P.periphylla, is a species that 
        thrives off low light, commonly found in deep-water fjords along the Norwegian coast. These fjords are 
        supporting increasing amounts of jellyfish due to water column darkening, where colored dissolved organic 
        matter flows into the water column and reduces light penetration (Sweetman & Chapman, 2015). Lurefjord, 
        western Norway, is thought to host the biggest population of P.periphylla, and is where Sweetman & Chapman’s 
        article observes the flux rate of jellyfish carcasses (jelly-falls). Sweetman & Chapman note that jellyfish 
        have a unique ability to “rapidly form massive, ephemeral blooms,” while their, and other gelatinous 
        zooplankton, carcasses have high sinking speeds, providing an important path for carbon to be exported to 
        the deep ocean. For example, off Oman and the Ivory Coast, jelly-falls cover up to 100% of the seafloor 
        in accumulations greater than 10 cm thick (Sweetman & Chapman, 2015). While significant, Sweetman & Chapman 
        suggest that the amount of jelly-falls may be underestimated due to benthic and demersal scavengers quickly 
        removing them from the seafloor, leading to a misleading contribution of jelly-falls to total carbon fluxes. 
        Therefore, as Sweetman & Chapman conjecture, with more jellyfish thriving in darkening fjord environments, 
        jellyfish may contribute more carbon in the biological pump, prompting the inclusion of a “jelly-pump” in 
        future models/studies.

    <h2 class="post-subheader">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Academic studies all recognize that diel vertical migration plays a fundamental role in the greater 
        biological pump, yet address the issues in fully assessing it - such as disregarding the contributions 
        of gelatinous zooplankton. Cook et al. and Archibald et al. characterize the global carbon network and 
        make an effort to parameterize DVM through empirical-based modelling. Narrowing the scope of focus, 
        Baker et al. sample mesozooplankton in order to gather data about the mesopelagic-migrant pump. These 
        three papers acknowledge the challenges in totally quantifying the biological pump, implying that due 
        to such difficulties, contemporary research is restricted. This is particularly the case for gelatinous 
        zooplankton as proper sampling is rather intricate. To flesh out these gaps, Jaspers et al., Sweetman & 
        Chapman observe specific taxa - larvaceans and jellyfish - noting that both offer avenues of carbon 
        export ignored in current models. To better predict climate change and ocean health, it is critical to 
        understand carbon sequestration; in order to better clarify this process, more studies regarding ignored 
        mesozooplankton species should be conducted. Furthermore, employing modelling software and taking more 
        data from around the globe could be a future avenue for research in order to track/quantify DVM. There 
        remains limited evidence on how gelatinous zooplankton affect ocean processes, such as diel vertical 
        migration, and thereby the biological pump.
