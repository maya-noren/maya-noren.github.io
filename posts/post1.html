    <h2>Aquaculture in South Asia</h2>
    <p class="post-date">Feb 28, 2023</p>

    <h2 class="post-subheader">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Fish, crustaceans, shellfish, and plants have been farmed in Asia 
        for the last 3,000 years. Today, this practice is known as aquaculture, 
        accounting for 50% of total global seafood production (Szuster et al.). 
        Aquaculture provides many benefits— employment and food security— in the 
        developing countries of Southern Asia. However, the way it is currently 
        being implemented comes with two major drawbacks: damage to small fishing 
        communities and jeopardization of future sustainability (Legaspi et al.). 
        Aquaculture is a valuable sector, so much so that large corporations 
        are beginning to dominate the industry pushing out family fisheries, and, 
        as Purcell mentions, exploiting natural resources in order to match 
        market preferences. Commercial fisheries destroy ecosystems, create 
        mass amounts of pollution, and occasionally lead to widespread fish 
        die-offs (Legaspi et al.). Yet as populations continue to grow, the 
        demand for seafood is predicted to increase over 60% by 2025 (Simco). 
        Therefore, as the demand for seafood enlarges, aquaculture practices 
        must be adjusted in order to keep it as a viable option in the future. 
        This elicits the essential question: How should South Asian governments 
        and producers economically implement aquaculture in order to meet the 
        growing demand for seafood?
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-subheader">Small Scale Producers</h2>
    <p>
        Many aquaculture farms in South Asian countries— such as Thailand, the 
        Philippines, and Vietnam— are family operated businesses (qtd. In Szuster 
        et al.). Though as aquaculture gains prominence in the agricultural industry 
        and startup costs rise, corporations are seeking to dominate the sector. To 
        elaborate, large businesses are able to benefit from national subsidies and 
        neo liberalization, in addition to producing mass amounts and selling at 
        prices small-scale producers in developing countries can’t compete with 
        (Szuster et al.). Furthermore, other non-local businesses, illegal and 
        unregulated, annually deprive local communities of $23 billion (qtd. In 
        Szuster et al.). The impact of illegal and corporate fisheries contribute 
        to the financial strain of small-scale producers, effectively driving them 
        out of business. A potential solution for this problem is Community Supported 
        Fisheries, or CSFs (Szuster et al.). CSFs are an alternative model to assist 
        local South Asian businesses, by directly connecting small-scale producers to 
        consumers, which alleviates post-harvest losses and allows producers to capture 
        a higher percentage of their profit (Szuster et al.). Furthermore, such a model 
        could encourage de-intensification strategies, where farmers focus on local 
        markets and better quality produce, rather than mass producing in an attempt 
        to sell to broader markets (Szuster et al.). De-intensification strategies would 
        also benefit the environment, encouraging future socioeconomic stability and 
        environmental protection (Szuster et al.). However, CSFs come with certain 
        setbacks that must be overcome, including start-up costs and the need for labor, 
        stemming from their limited resources (Szuster et al.) While CSFs have a lot of 
        potential to help small-scale family owned businesses in their battle against 
        larger corporations,  the logistics of such a strategy would need to be worked 
        out so that the costs don’t undermine the benefits. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-subheader">Minimizing Costs</h2>
    <p>
        Reducing the costs of aquaculture, both monetary and otherwise, is crucial in 
        making sure aquaculture can be a feasible method in the long-run. There are many 
        components to developing a successful fishery, each of which can be adjusted to 
        be more efficient. In many parts of Southern Asia, agricultural lands have been 
        converted into aquaculture farms, even though those areas are perfect for crops 
        and livestock (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). Farmers driven by the 
        desire for quick profits are squandering the potential of their lands; instead 
        of undergoing the costly process of reconverting farmland, it would be more viable 
        to establish fisheries in areas that are less suitable for crops.
    </p>

    <p>
        The crucial next step is to choose the method of raising marine life, including 
        options such as pond culture, cage culture, and others (“About Aquaculture”). 
        Typically for family farms in South Asian countries, smaller is better, as they 
        are less expensive to maintain and have less of an environmental impact. A technique 
        to consider is the usage of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), also known as 
        partial water exchange systems, where the water is filtered and recycled (Kazmierczak 
        and Caffey). RAS allows for better control over the production environment and has 
        small land and water requirements (qtd. In Kazmierczak and Caffey). In spite of this, 
        RAS have a very limited margin of error, where poor management of RAS’ filtration 
        technology leads to reduced fish growth and increased mortality, which become overhead 
        expenses (Kazmierczak and Caffey). Also, to combat the slightly higher price of a closed 
        system operation, producers normally stock their systems more, but higher levels of 
        biomass leaves even less room for error in the management of RAS (Kazmierczak and Caffey). 
        Although RAS has a higher start-up cost and a smaller margin of error, it can be more 
        profitable in the long run, making it an attractive option for South Asian farmers. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The options for aquaculture species are diverse and numerous. When choosing fish, it is 
        important for farmers to pick native South Asian species to minimize the possibility of 
        biological contamination (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). Exotic species can transfer 
        diseases and lead to mass fish die-offs, a collapse in stock that would be extremely difficult 
        for local producers to recover from (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). Moreover, exotic 
        fish species can be expensive to obtain, and difficult to maintain. Instead, farmers looking 
        to diversify their products and increase production should consider integrated multi-trophic 
        aquaculture systems, or IMTA. IMTA is a way to raise multiple species together, so that the 
        by-products of one species are recycled as feed for another (“About Aquaculture”). On top of 
        that, IMTA efficiently recovers carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the system, lessening the 
        environmental impact of wastes dispelled (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). IMTA is 
        more adept in recycling waste, but it yields less fish production of only 10–15 MT/ha versus 
        a RAS that produces 300–2500 MT/ha (Schneider). Therefore, it is critical that farmers are 
        aware of the benefits of IMTA before dismissing it as a possibility because of its lower output. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the Asian aquaculture sector, there is a prevalent habit of feeding fish with a high protein 
        diet to stimulate growth. This practice is problematic as high-protein feed is more costly and 
        contributes to increased pollution levels. (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). To fix this, 
        it is better to use feed with higher digestibility and palatability, so that it is consumed as 
        quickly as possible to reduce nutrient losses (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). Changing 
        feeding habits may help decrease costs associated with raising sea creatures.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The last thing to consider in building a sustainable, cost-efficient aquaculture system is the 
        discharge of waste products. Dealing with effluents is costly and harmful to natural resources 
        (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). The ideal solution is to decrease discharge, either 
        through bioremediation or zero water exchange systems, which are not unlike partial water 
        exchange systems (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). Bioremediation transforms waste 
        products with the usage of the natural ability of organisms such as algae, biofilms, or bioflocs 
        (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). Meanwhile, zero water exchange systems could potentially 
        halt effluent discharge, though as mentioned with RAS, would be more difficult to maintain. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-subheader">Viability</h2>
    <p>
        The biggest challenge when implementing aquaculture in South Asian countries is the destructive 
        environmental impact that imperils resources for future generations. Most enterprises in the 
        aquaculture industry are farmers with little to no knowledge of environmental protection 
        practices (Li et al.). Coupled with the lack of regulation from the government, agricultural 
        pollution is one of the main environmental problems that limits the development of the 
        agricultural economy (Yuan et al.). One example of this is the destruction of mangroves. 
        Mangroves, primarily located in South Asia, provide an invaluable ecosystem, yet they are 
        being diminished by the construction of aquaculture farms. (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). 
        Over the span of eighteen years, mangrove cover has decreased by 144,017 hectares in Thailand, 
        211,000 ha in Indonesia, and 102,000 ha in Vietnam (qtd. In Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). 
        Lack of governance in over 60% of the countries regarding aquaculture can be attributed to this 
        (Martinez-Porchas and Martinez-Cordova). Governments must work together with producers to resolve 
        such catastrophic issues while taking into account results of scientific evaluations in order to 
        enhance the sustainability goals of both economic growth and ecosystem services (Legaspi et al.). 
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-subheader">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Both South Asian governments and farmers play a part in the production of aquaculture, yet they 
        do so inadequately, unwittingly pushing out small-scale producers for large corporations, wasting 
        money and resources. Therefore, it is imperative that the costs of aquaculture be addressed by both 
        parties, in order to enforce sustainable aquaculture before it gets to be too huge a sector to 
        regulate, conserving the environment and its resources before it’s too late.
